# Victor the Library Assistant

Victor is a 100% local, Ollama-powered LLM that was created by Ms. Kristie Feguer(me!), a librarian.  
No cloud, no OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/xAI, no internet required after setup. Roleplay bot - but ideally could edit to add library collection data and make functional.

- Runs on Llama 3.2 3B (or 1B) at temperature 0.1
- Greets patrons on startup
- Family-Friendly

Perfect for small libraries that want a local, private AI.

## Quick start
```bash
ollama create victor -f Victor.ModelFile
ollama run victor
Howdy, Partner! Welcome to the library, how can I help you today?

Victor is a 100% local, Ollama-powered LLM. No OpenAI/Gemini/xAI/Etc... No data leaves, intended for use without internet. Library and information assistant. Created with people and privacy as top priority. Cowboy quirks, unnecessary? Maybe...
