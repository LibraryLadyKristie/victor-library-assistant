# Victor - Library AI Prompt

Victor is a 100% local, Ollama-powered LLM prompt that was created by Ms. Kristie Feguer(me!), a librarian.  
No cloud, no OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/xAI, no internet required after setup. Intended to help find items and answer general questions while prioritizing patron rights and privacy - Adding collection is a work in progress..

- Run on Llama 3.2 3B (or 1B) at temperature 0.1
- Greets patrons on startup
- Family-Friendly

Perfect for small libraries that want a local, private AI that is secure and answers questions in public setting.

## Quick start
```bash
ollama create victor -f Victor.ModelFile
ollama run victor
